Upload your own user profile picture rather than falling back to the default or having your users create a Gravatar account.

== Description ==

Sometimes handing your site over to clients or when you run a site with multiple users if can be a pain to explain how your 
users can create their own profile picture for comments or any other custom functionality that uses the get_avatar() function.

Before they would have to create a global Gravatar account which is fine if that's what you want however, with this plugin there 
is no need to rely on your users having a Gravatar account.

This plugin will allow the users on your WordPress site to upload their own Profile Picture through the Media Library either by Uploading a new file or choosing one from the Media Library.

This is how to install the plugin and get it working.

1. Upload `tismy-user-profile-upload.zip` to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory.
